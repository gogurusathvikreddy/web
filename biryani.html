             <h4><b>Instructions:</b></h4>
 
             In a large bowl, combine the chicken, curd, onions, mint, coriander, green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well to coat the chicken.
             Cover the bowl and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.
             Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the bay leaf, cinnamon sticks, cloves, and star anise. Cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant.
             Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the rice is slightly translucent.
             Add 4 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through but still firm to the bite.
             Drain the rice and set aside.

             In a separate bowl, whisk together the yogurt, saffron milk, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt.
             Heat the ghee in a large pot over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until browned on all sides.
             Add the cooked rice and yogurt mixture to the pot. Stir to combine.
             Cover the pot and cook for 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is heated through.
             Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes, covered.
             Fluff the rice with a fork and serve hot.

             Enjoy!
